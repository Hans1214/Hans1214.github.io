            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Hans Ricohermoso a multidisciplinary creator with a passion for design, development, and movement. By day, I craft user-friendly experiences as a developer and designer, blending creativity with technology. By night, I channel my energy into fitness coaching, where I help others discover the joy of movement (and yes, I jump a lot!).

            When I’m not coding or coaching, you’ll probably find me experimenting in the kitchen, whipping up something delicious, or catching up on some much-needed sleep to fuel all my passions. Life is a balancing act, and I’m always excited to learn, create, and inspire wherever I go. I can fly.</p>
